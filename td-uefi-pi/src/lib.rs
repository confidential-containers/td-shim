//! UEFI Platform Initialization data structures and accessors.
//!
//! This crate defines constants and data structures defined by the
//! [UEFI-PI Spec](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/PI_Spec_1_6.pdf)
//! and needed by the `td-shim` project. It also provides functions to parse those data structures
//! from raw data buffer.
//!
//! Constants and data structures defined by [UEFI PI Spec] are hosted by [crate::pi], functions
//! to access them are hosted by [crate::fv] and [crate::hob].
